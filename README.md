PG Migrator
===========

A simple migration, which runs pure Postgres SQL files. 

Drop ```<timestamp>_desc.sql``` files in ```db/migrations``` (and corresponding ```<timestamp>_desc_down.sql``` files if you want to be able to downgrade). 

Gemfile:

    require 'pg-migrator/tasks'
    # Make sure to have a DATABASE_URL environment variable
    ENV['DATABASE_URL'] = "postgres://user:passwd@host/db"
    # or if using sockets and default user
    ENV['DATABASE_URL'] = "postgres:db"

Then as usually:

    rake db:reset # drops the "public" schema in your database (not the database it self or any other schemas)
    rake db:migrate:up # runs all migrations in order
    rake db:migrate:down # runs the down migration for the latest applied migration
